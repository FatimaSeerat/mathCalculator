💻 Built a Calculator Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript ✨

I’m happy to share that I have successfully created a functional Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Through this project, I practiced:

✔️ Structuring layout with HTML
✔️ Styling and designing with CSS
✔️ Implementing calculation logic with JavaScript

This project helped me improve my logical thinking and strengthened my front-end development skills. Building functionality from scratch gave me more confidence in writing clean and efficient code.
